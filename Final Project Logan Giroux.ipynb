    "This is a basic programming language capable of working with functions, arithmetic operations, strings, and arrays. It is built upon the Cuppa3 language and could be useful for someone working with complex lists of lsits (of lists, etc.) of numbers. It could also prove useful in schools to help younger children learn the basics of coding. I belive that given nature of the syntax, this language would make function calls a little easier to understand. This can be observed with the array calls such as prepend and insert, which are very similar to function calls with parameters. "

    "I faced a few challenges while working on this project. If I were to do it again, I would forgo many of the basic features of the language and focus more on using an array architecture for the array structure. The arrays are fucntional on the surface, but if one were to use this language for any sort of work, I think they would find it to be quite useless. It serves a purpose in the sense of it being a showcase of what I have learned this semester, but as far as being a useful bit of code, I think it falls short. If I had more time, I would have liked to go back and adjust all of the code having to deal with arrays so that actual arrays or vectors were used behind the scenes. I believe this would have added much more functionality to the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, I do believe the project to be a success. I successfully implemented strings, without being able to find any inputs that break the structure and result in an error. The array structure can be used in an (albeit limited) multidimensional fashion and could provide useful to the right line of work. Numbers and/or arrays can be appended, prepended, or inserted into all slots of existing arrays, allowing for complex list generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, I ran into a problem when implementing my 'pull' function, which would have allowed for a user to pull data from a given index of an array. I have left this code in the 'cuppa3_interp_walk' file starting at line 224. For some reason it gives a syntax error when I attempt to use the pull call, as shown in a test below. This was one major setback and resulted in many frustrating hours staring a screen, as I truly cannot figure out why a syntax error would result. The pull command is nearly identical to the insert command, which is why the error is so puzzling to me. Alas, thankfully I was able to keep that problem contained to one command without it spreading to the rest of the code."

I did not showcase other aspects of the language because you are obviously aware of how the functions work and how basic arithmetic operations work. I'm a little upset about the 'pull' command not working, but I did the best I could. I tried many different things to fix it, such as declaring x as an array and updating the symbol table respectively, or by simply declaring x within the 'pull_exp' function instead of updating the symbol table. \n",
